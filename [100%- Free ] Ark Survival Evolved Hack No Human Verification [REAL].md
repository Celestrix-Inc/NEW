<br>ARK: Survival Evolved hasn‚Äôt seen any updates since 343.17, and even that one wasn‚Äôt very significant. The only changes to the game were fixes to the fishing mission on Genesis Part 1 as well as a fix to a common issue that used to occur when fishing from the Canoe.
<br>
<br>Most of the recent updates for ARK have been relatively minor, focusing on fixing bugs and patching out exploits. For example, the developers managed to fix an issue that made it impossible to complete the Star Dolphin mission. Sinomacrops will also no longer eat kibble.
<br>
<br>On January 5th, the developers of ARK: Survival Evolved released a minor update for the game. Changes included the removal of some game exploits, the filling of some invisible holes in the lost island, as well as fixes for the loot crate spawns related to Massive and Devious artifacts.
<br>
<br>Released since the start of late November, so far, all of the ARK patches in the 340 version of the game have focused on fixing minor exploits and issues. For example, 340.8 fixed a crash that occurred during the Survive The ARK mission, and 340.10 fixed a problem that made it impossible to deploy the Exo-Mek.
<br>
<br>ARK: Survival Evolved‚Äôs most recent update was patch 339.14, and it mostly focused on improving many of the game‚Äôs bugs. The most notable changes were improvements to the game‚Äôs level design, including the removal of invisible holes, foliage that would be floating, and similar problems. Another improvement is that Rock Drakes can now be spayed and neutered.
<br>
<br>The last update to ARK was the one released on the 20th of September, and it featured several bug fixes and updates to make the game more functional. For example, the UI will no longer shrink each time you hit the spacebar to see the camera list. Some text has also been updated to remove types and Stadia default settings have been changed.
<br>
<br>While ARK Survival Evolved‚Äôs most recent update wasn‚Äôt exactly a huge one, it brought the game to an entirely different platform: Google Stadia. Along with the game now being available on Google‚Äôs cloud gaming platform, Patch 678.10 also fixed a few bugs and updated Vivox.
<br>
<br>Survival games have seen immense success lately, one only must only look to Rust to see a survival game that‚Äôs flourishing, even late in its life cycle. While we‚Äôre used to video games putting us in a position of power, there‚Äôs something charming about being at the mercy of the elements.
<br>
<br>ARK: Survival Evolved is often compared to Rust, and while the games may share a similar genre, there are a few key differences between them. One of them is the wildlife in ARK, which we‚Äôre sure you know is filled with prehistoric creatures that you can tame and harness for your needs.
<br>
<br>While both games strand you on an island with limited resources to survive with, Rust tends to be a little more grounded in reality. ARK, on the other hand, expects you to suspend your disbelief from the very beginning. Most gamers won‚Äôt soon forget the first time they were eviscerated by a velociraptor.

<br>
<br>Of course, most survival games also incorporate a hefty amount of base building, and the same is true in ARK. You can expect to ally with other players, pooling your resources so that you can survive against the deadly wilderness and the best efforts of other players to set you back.
<br>
<br>Unfortunately, one of the things that disappoints the community the most about ARK is that the game locks a lot of things behind hours of grinding. While we understand that you have to make the progress in a game feel rewarding, there‚Äôs a fine line between doing so and driving off potential players.
<br>
<br>A lot of people are barely able to scratch the surface of what ARK has to offer before they decide to give up and opt for another game entirely. This is a shame because ARK lets you do things that you‚Äôd only ever dream of in other games, but not many people have the time to play the game like a second job.
<br>
<br>In spite of this, ARK has a loyal fanbase and plenty of opportunities for new players to get into it. The game maintains new player servers that constantly wipe so you can try out the basics without getting yourself destroyed by enemies that have fully automatic gatling guns and steel fortresses.
<br>
<br>If there‚Äôs one thing to be said for ARK, it‚Äôs that the game isn‚Äôt afraid of going over the top. Unlike other titles, ARK doesn‚Äôt take itself too seriously, and its players are rewarded for the game‚Äôs mix of survival elements, sci-fi technology, and dinosaurs that you can turn into pets.
<br>
<br>ARK: Survival Evolved Hacks
<br>
<br>Like many games that have been out for a long time, ARK has developed something of a reputation for being filled with cheaters, and this isn‚Äôt exactly false. If you ever find yourself getting killed in suspicious circumstances, then you may have been on the receiving end of a hacker‚Äôs wrath.
<br>
<br>Of course, since a large presence of hackers tends to drive away legitimate players, ARK‚Äôs devs do everything they can to make it difficult for people to cheat. Thankfully, due to the relative transparency of their anti-cheat efforts, it isn‚Äôt too hard for us to find ways around them with our cheats.
<br>
<br>ARK uses a two-pronged approach to anti-cheat, which isn‚Äôt seen in many other games. The first line of defense is VAC, or Valve Anti-Cheat, which is used in titles like Team Fortress 2 or CSGO. VAC has a reputation for being relatively harsh and banning many players without warning, but it‚Äôs also a little outdated.
<br>
<br>While VAC may be a good choice for competitive shooters, it isn‚Äôt quite as well-made for games like ARK. This is why ARK has its second line of defense: BattlEye, which is used in games like Rainbow Six Siege. BattlEye does a pretty good job of making up for the vulnerabilities in VAC.
<br>
<br>However, even together these anti-cheat systems don‚Äôt work too well when going up against modern hacks made by professional developers. An interesting thing about ARK is that you can host servers without anti-cheat enabled, which is something that most games wouldn‚Äôt even consider letting you do.
<br>
<br>This allows you to start up a private server with all of your cheats enabled and you won‚Äôt have to worry about getting banned while you test everything out. This is a great way to get acquainted with your new abilities, and you can even run servers with your friends where everyone has hacks enabled.
<br>
<br>Keep in mind that automated anti-cheat isn‚Äôt the only thing that you‚Äôll have to look out for when you‚Äôre using ARK wall hack cheats. Other players can still report you manually, and if you end up being the subject of too many reports, you‚Äôll end up getting your gameplay reviewed and potentially banned. [SH9D!]
